# KnightsPath

This python script finds the shortest path a knight can take
between two squares on a chessboard. 

User input should be in the format of space separated chess 
squares. Users can input as many lines of chess squares as 
they want. Once all lines have been inserted, hitting enter 
twice will run the algorithm and display the shortest paths
found for each line.

Assumptions

If the starting square and target square are equal then the
shortest path is 0-moves
